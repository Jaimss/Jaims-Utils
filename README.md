A collection of Minecraft utilities for Bukkit/Bungeecord Plugin Development - so you don't need to create that Utils class every time ;)


#### Language Support
This project uses Kotlin. The majority of these features make use of Kotlin's [extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html).
This allows for you to use features like `Player#send("&3message")` and it will automatically color the message for you, however this does have some downsides if you are working in Java.
You will still be able to use all the methods provided, however it will be slightly different. Please see the [java usage](https://github.com/Jaimss/mcutils/wiki/Java-Usage) page on the wiki.
**I strongly suggest giving Kotlin a try! It will make your life easier using this package, and it is all around better in my opinion.**

#### Bungeecord v Bukkit
This project was made with both Bungeecord and Bukkit in mind. 
When making a Bukkit plugin, you can include the Bukkit module as a dependency, and when making a Bungeecord plugin, you can include the Bungeecord dependency.
